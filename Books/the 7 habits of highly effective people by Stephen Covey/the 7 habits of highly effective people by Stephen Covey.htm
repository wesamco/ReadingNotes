<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Be Proactive</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reactive people always focus on the things that they cannot
control. <br>
On the other hand, proactive people realize, even their complaining were
completely objective, it doesn't help them. So they focus on what they can
control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a proactive person owns a business where he sells a
product,<br>
instead of focusing on how people these days don’t appreciate good products
anymore, <br>
and how the government has horrible regulations, <br>
he focuses on, <b>“How can I improve my product, so my customers can’t live
without it?”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you realize how much <b>responsibility</b>, how much <b>dedication</b>?
<br>
how much <b>hard work</b> comes along with asking that question?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what do you think our effort-minimizing brain is going
to pick as default?<br>
And that is exactly why most people focus on the things that they cannot
control,<br>
rather than focusing on the things that they can.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Begin with the End in mind</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now imagine you’re at a funeral, but this one’s different
from all the funerals<br>
you've ever been to. You’re standing over the casket and you<br>
see yourself. <b>What do you have to say about yourself?</b><br>
This is one of the most powerful questions you could ask.<br>
<b>Are you doing the things in your life, which are aligned with what you want
to be<br>
able to say?</b> Do you want to say that you were a good spouse?<br>
If that’s the case, how does coming home and instantly being negative<br>
towards your spouse affect that? Do you want to be remembered as a person who<br>
added value to society? If that’s the case,<br>
<b>are you doing the things that will allow you to say that,<br>
or are you scared of failure and choose comfortable mediocrity instead?<br>
</b>every one of us will have to readjust how we live when we ask that question.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Put first things first</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Now if I were to ask you, <b>“What are the most important things to you?”<br>
</b>The most common answers I would get would be<br>
either your <b>wellbeing</b>, or your <b>relationships</b>—your <b>family</b>,
your<br>
<b>spouse</b>, your <b>children</b>. You would never ever say, <i>“Organizing
papers<br>
or watching TV</i>…” But how many of us <b>spend more time</b> organizing<br>
papers and watching TV, than planning our nutrition and going to the<br>
gym, or cultivating a healthy family environment?<br>
<b>There’s a horrible disconnect between what we say<br>
and how we actually allocate our time.</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Think win-win</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>think win-win. Stop thinking of everything as a zero-sum game.
For you to win, another person does not have to lose. <br>
Now imagine you’re an author, and I’m an author.<br>
And We both write interesting books, and we both have access to an audience of<br>
about a , people. I read your book and I love it.<br>
So I decide to share it with my audience. And as a result,<br>
you now have ,s of people buying your book and reading your ideas.<br>
You see this and think, “Who is this guy? Let me take a look at his book.”<br>
You start reading my book and think I have ideas that are valuable.<br>
So you decide to share it with your audience. And as a result,<br>
I now have ,100s of people buying my book and reading my ideas.<br>
Notice how different this is from my creating a little creepy Amazon account,<br>
finding your book and leaving a bad review, hoping that this will deter a few
people from<br>
buying your book, which will in turn somehow get them to buy<br>
my book.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Seek first to understand</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something I want my viewers to do is to subscribe to my
channel,<br>
but you will never hear me say, “Well, I worked really hard guys.<br>
I dedicated so many hours to this. Please subscribe.”<br>
Look, who cares if I worked hard? Who cares if I’ve spent days creating this<br>
video? The real questions are,<br>
does it offer value to you? And Why should you dedicate your time to
subscribing,<br>
when you could be doing anything else that you want?<br>
Habit number  is something that I try to use every single day,<br>
with every interaction that I have, and with every comment that I reply to,<br>
and it is this seek first to understand, then to be understood.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Synergize</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now imagine there are two people, and a tree with five
apples on it.<br>
They are both too short to reach the apples, but if one of them sits on the
other’s shoulders,<br>
he can reach all five of the apples. This is called synergy.<br>
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br>
Now I’ll be the first to admit that you can’t achieve this with everyone,<br>
but you should always be looking for opportunities to create synergy.<br>
With every synergistic opportunity you create, you can gather many more apples
than you otherwise<br>
would by yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:107%'>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:
107%'>Sharpen the saw</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A man has been trying to cut down a tree for hours.<br>
And after a while his neighbor can’t take it anymore,<br>
goes over and says, “You know, if you sharpen the saw, you’ll<br>
be able to cut it down faster.” And the man replies,<br>
“But, sharpening the saw is going to take time.”<br>
Now we might laugh at this story, but we do the same thing all the time.<br>
We can’t find  minutes a day,  times a week to go to the gym.<br>
Our health deteriorates to a point, where we’re physically incapable of being<br>
effective. We can’t read a book for  minutes a day<br>
and mentally stimulate ourselves. No! These things take too much time!<br>
And then we have the audacity to ask for little tips and tricks on how to be
effective.<br>
It’s like telling your engineer, “Don’t worry about the foundation,<br>
where can we get the magic bricks that will float in the air?”</p>
